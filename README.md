# sosc_test

project to test client features on sockscape before being added to the networking content. 
this project runs natively rather than in browser to make testing features much quicker.
a lot of things in this will be testing purely client side graphical or related features before working it into the main code and therefore will not include or contain everything that the main source will have

this project currently includes these subprojects:
- koa (common c utilities and datatypes library for things i frequently need)
- okuu (opengl helper library that provides structs and funcs to make working with opengl cleaner)
- rbm (reemo binary mesh, utilities for a binary file format to store 3d mesh data)
